    "Q1.Discuss string slicing and provide examples?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "    In python string slicing means, to remove subsequence or smaller parts of the string. eg,\n",
    "    you dont need the full string, you just want to use a small protion of that string, \n",
    "    to do that you need to perform string slicing feature in python.\n",
    "    string slicing is done on index based value (The index number of every value), \n",
    "    Index in python starts from 0\n",
    "    Slicing is perform using [] square brackes around the string, inside the square bracket we perform slicing.\n",
    "String slicing \n",
    "This is an example\n",
    "    string[start:end:step]\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Start: start is the entry gate of the string\n",
    "       This is the starting of the string, from here we can start slicing, if you don't provide,\n",
    "       a value to the start, the default value is 0 of the start, it will start slicing, \n",
    "       from the 0 value (start of the string) entry point of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "End: ennd is the boundary of the string\n",
    "    This is the ending of the string, means slicing can be performed till this(value),\n",
    "    it is the end point of the string, the end point is also an exclusive part of the slicing,\n",
    "    if you dont specify the end point of the string to the slicing feature, the feature will automaticlly\n",
    "    perform slicing till the end of the string(end point of the string).\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip: Skip is the jump size of the string, \n",
    "      if the step is 2 then it will pick every first character skipping 1,\n",
    "      if you provide -1 step in, in this case you will run reverse in the string.\n",
    "      skip means how many characters to skip while performing slicing, if the step is 2, the slicing\n",
    "      will run in sequence,\n",
    "      if skip is 2 , it will pick every second character from the string(skipping 1)\n",
    "      if the step is in negative(-1), means to slice the string from end boundary to the entry point(in reverse form).\n",
    "           \n",
    "Note: 1. In string slicing, every time a new part or substring is created or returns the value,\n",
    "      in the form of substring, Original string will be always remain intact(firstly created).\n",
    "      2. You can use positive and negative indices in to perform slicing\n",

    "Q2. Explain the key features of the list in python?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "    List in an built-in data structure(data type), list is use as a collections of items, we can use list to group multiple values in a one entity.\n",
    "    list supports various operations for managing and manupulating these values\n",
    "\n",
    "The key features of the list are as following:\n",
    "    1. Maintain Order:\n",
    "        List maintain the orders of the elements in their inserted order, preserves the order of elements,\n",
    "        you can access the list values through their position basis(through indices)\n",
    "    2. Mutable:\n",
    "        List are mutable, means you can add, modify or remove elements, after an list is created\n",
    "        it return an new list, and the original list remains intact.\n",
    "    3. Index Slicing:\n",
    "        one can access the list elements using their positions and can extract specific parts of the list using slicing feature\n",
    "        list allow slicing through the index numbers of the elements stored in the list.\n",
    "    3. Iterable:\n",
    "        You can iterate using loop inside a list , which gives the benefits of doing operations on every element in the list,\n",
    "        enabling you to the process of manipulate each element present in the list.\n",
    "    4. Allow mixed type (data types):\n",
    "        In a list, there can be elements of different data types together making a single list.\n",
    "        example: data types list can store together are integers, strings, floats and even an another list(is also knowns as nested list).\n",

    "    Use cases of tuples and sets are as following:\n",
    "Use cases of Tuple:\n",
    "1. Immutable:\n",
    "    When you need an data which is constant(cannot be changed), in this case you can use tuples \n",
    "    for eg: coordinates (x, y), you cannot modify the tuple, once it is created.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    storing locations like (13,07, 72,87) # as of i am from mumbai\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Fixed Data Structure:\n",
    "    when you want to ensure the fixed size of data, in this case we ensure, that we use tuples,\n",
